# Poll Smart Contract with Proof-of-Stake Voting

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description
This smart contract enables decentralized polling using a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. Participants vote on a given question by staking Ether, where the weight of their vote is proportional to the amount of ETH staked. This design discourages spam voting and encourages more deliberate participation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a more democratic, secure, and decentralized voting mechanism where influence is determined by commitment (in the form of staked ETH) rather than arbitrary identity systems.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Stake-Based Voting:** Users stake ETH to cast their vote, increasing trust and reducing spam.
- **Weighted Results:** Votes are counted based on the amount of ETH staked.
- **Owner-Controlled Voting Lifecycle:** Only the poll creator can close voting, locking the results.
- **Transparent and Trustless:** Anyone can view the votes and verify the outcome directly on-chain.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- **Token-Based Voting Support:** Enable staking with ERC20 tokens instead of ETH.
- **Multi-Question Polls:** Support for multi-question and multi-choice surveys.
- **Automated Closing:** Add timers or block numbers to auto-close polls.
- **Result Verification UI:** Front-end DApp to visualize results and audit votes.
